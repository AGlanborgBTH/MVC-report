These files are med for me to learn and practise; using object oriented programming with php

The content of this projekt are a few webpages compiled with symfony. Each page is different and is suppose to be built up with different techinques and practrises.

The project is only used as a display of understanding the course material and is not meant to become anything big or anything for the public

Content contained are:

  A report page with information regarding me and reports on each section of the course
  
  A card page, dispaying how we can make larger amounts of content with little code, contained in classes
  
  A BJ (Black jack) page, with a game of blackjack. This page was made to practise using logic in controllers and working with both classes and controllers
  
  A library page, containing pictures and information regarding characters. This page was made to display how an database can be implemented into the work
  
  A proj page, containing the final project of the course. This page was made for displaying the techinques and methods used troughout the course
